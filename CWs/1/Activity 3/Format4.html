	<h1> Formatting Text </h1>
	<h2> "Paragraphs and line breaks." </h2>
Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control over the
way that a page is displayed. <br> It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means
of marking up the structure of a document not as a way of determining its presentation. <p>
Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from formatting text to appear </p> in a printed document.
